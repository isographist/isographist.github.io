<h2>Furry Weekend Atlanta 2025</h2>
<p><em>June 1, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>After each convention, I like to reflect on my time spent. Leading up to a con, it's too easy to get swept up in the
hype, and during a con, it's too chaotic to think big picture. I've found that taking some time to reflect after each
con has significantly improved my convention going experience over time.</p>
<p>Here is my reflection on FWA 2025. This isn't a review of the convention itself (I thought it was ran adequately), nor
is it my feelings attending the con (I had an amazing time). Instead, it's my thoughts on how effectively I was able to
enjoy the convention.</p>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Packing my fursuit head in my carry on</em>. I hadn't realized how stressed I had been flying to previous conventions
with my fursuit head in my checked bag. Having my fursuit head on the plane with me was oddly comforting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sleeping in</em>. I've had trouble sleeping in at previous conventions partly because it's my natural tendency to wake up
early, and partly because I worry about getting ahead of the lines for e.g. coffee, elevators, and the Dealer's Den.
This FWA, I was able to let go of the latter. Learning to effectively sleep-in meant I had more energy in the
afternoons and evenings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Taking the bookends off from work.</em> I think this is reflective of my burnout, but taking a day off before the con to
fully decompress from work, and a day off after the con to fully decompress from the convention, let me stay in the
moment more throughout the con.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Having more substantive conversations.</em> Part of my exhaustion attending conventions has been having the same tedious
conversations: &quot;how was your flight here?&quot;, &quot;did you go to the dealer's den?&quot;, &quot;how was the party yesterday?&quot;, &quot;how
long did you suit for?&quot;, &quot;when's your flight home?&quot;. I think they serve a purpose, but this con, I made a
conscientious effort to move past introductory topics quickly.</p>
<p>Because of that, I felt I got to meet a lot more people where they're at: I discussed workaholism with one person, and
chastity with another. I listened to a green card holder as they recounted their worry about being unlawfully
deported. I had a wonderful brunch chatting about how to balance career ambitions with relationship goals.</p>
<p>At the end of the con, I felt energized — it was entertaining and engaging to get a slice of each person's life, and
I'm grateful to anyone who was willing to dive deep with me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What could have gone better?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Planning my travel to the convention.</em> My flight was early Thursday morning — it was the cheapest flight to Atlanta
that day, but waking up at 3am to catch it was no fun. With more foresight, I would have taken my savings from the
flight and booked a hotel near LaGuardia, spent Wednesday in New York City, and woken up closer to my flight time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do I wish I did differently?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Interacted more with other silent suiters.</em> I had a blast workshopping someone's suiting performance at FWA: it was
engaging to think about their character's backstory, motivation, and design, and to incorporate that into the way
their character moves and interacts. I'd love to spend more time workshopping others' performances, as well as getting
critique of my own.</li>
</ul>
