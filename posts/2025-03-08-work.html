<h2>Workaholics anonymous</h2>
<p><em>March 8, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I work, <strong>a lot</strong>. I track around fifty to sixty hours of focused work time per week. At the end of the day, I'm often exhaustedâ€”too tired to do more than just reply to friends, take a shower, brush my teeth, and crash. </p>
<p>More than the hours though, work consumes my life. I've given up on social engagements and conventions to prioritize work deadlines. Recently, I worked until midnight with a colleague in order to unblock a different colleague, and ended up crashing on the first colleague's couch because I missed the train home. </p>
<p>I'm a workaholic.</p>
<h3>But, why?</h3>
<p>This is something I've been reckoning with recently. I think there are a few main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>I see an opportunity for career growth.</strong> </p>
<p>At the risk of sounding too much like a LinkedIn post, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a factor. I work at a relatively young company, and the ratio of work to people is still quite high. I feel I have the opportunity to show off my skills, and, to that end, grow my career at an early stage of my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm having fun!</strong> </p>
<p>I enjoy building, solving problems, and discussing tradeoffs. I work with a bunch of really smart, talented, compassionate, and funny people.</p>
<p>My job also gives me some personal independence to pursue what I want, and I have taken full advantage of that: I've prototyped and shipped changes in days or weeks, and it's <em>really</em> addicting to see a one-off idea you had two weeks ago make it into production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm learning.</strong> </p>
<p>I feel that each new skill I learn or piece of knowledge I gain compounds with everything before, and will likely compound with everything after. And unlike physical goods or money, it's not something that I can lose.</p>
<p>The fastest way to learn is to make mistakes, and, believe me, I have made <em>a lot</em> of mistakes. But making mistakes requires goodwill from the people around you, and that goodwill is rare. That goodwill accumulates when I succeed and diminishes when I fail, so I try my best to ensure that I always have goodwill saved up for when I need it, which I think further fuels my workaholism.</p>
<p>I also grow restless when I'm not learning. Part of me gets worried I'm not doing enough with my life, but that's something to unpack another time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>For the future</h3>
<p>I wasn't always a workaholic. When I first moved to California about three years ago, I worked a lot less. Instead, I spent time with friends, went to conventions, ate at restaurants, and sang in a choir. But over time, I slowly grew more and more dissatisfied. I had that itch to learn and grow, and I didn't feel I was getting that day-to-day.</p>
<p>At that point in my life, my time spent working was low, but my self drive was rising. I was growing restless, so I found a new job, moved to New York, and worked my tail off.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph of two sine waves. One labeled &quot;Self drive&quot;, the other labeled &quot;Time spent working&quot;." src="../resources/2025-03-08-work.png" /></p>
<p>If I plot my time spent working and my self drive over time, they trace out sine waves, with time spent working trailing self drive. I think it makes sense: if my self drive decreases, my time spent working also goes down. Then, I begin to grow restless: my self drive starts to increase, and I start to work harder. At some point, I grow tired and my self drive starts to decrease. The expectations I set for myself are still there, so I keep working, but I try and find ways to escape work more and more, until I'm back where I started. </p>
<p>This plot extends further back in time, and although past performance is not indicative of future results, I expect it will extend into the future as well.</p>
<p>Where I'm at now, I think I've just passed the crest of the "Time spent" wave (the dotted line to the right). I sense I'm about to make a big shift in my life, though I'm not sure what it'll be quite yet.</p>
