<h2>Anthrocon 2025: from Deep Sea Adventure to Thalassophobia</h2>
<p><em>July 27, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>As a bit of background, I honestly wasn't planning on going to Anthrocon this year; the con itself is amazing, but after
last year, I thought I'd had enough. However, the day before the convention, I was offered space in the Omni by a
friend.</p>
<p>As soon as I was given the option, I realized all the logistical hurdles I'd need to jump through: <em>I'll need to get
home and pack and coordinate arrival and make sure I don't pass out while driving.</em> Unfortunately, I've gotten good
enough at figuring that stuff out that, by the next day, I was buckled to the seat of my car coasting through
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I'd been feeling burnt out — not just at work, but in life in general. I thought going to Anthrocon might help with
that: a con with no plans would surely be more relaxing than one with a jam-packed agenda. In hindsight, knowing the
kind of person I am, a last-minute con ended up being way more stressful. <em>Just because I can go to a convention doesn't
mean I should.</em></p>
<p>This isn't a review of the convention itself (I thought it was ran exceedingly well), nor is it my feelings attending
the con (I had a mediocre time). Instead, it's my thoughts on how effectively I was able to enjoy the convention.</p>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Bringing my camera.</em> At a friend's recommendation, I recently purchased a
<a href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf">Sigma BF</a>, and taking photos with it has been such a wonderful
introduction to photography. Most of the photos I took were crap, but the experience of taking photos — setting up the
shot, pressing the shutter button, and editing it afterwards — has been an amazing hands-on learning experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What could have gone better?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Disconnecting.</em> I went to Anthrocon to escape, but the last minute nature of it made me more anxious. I couldn't give
myself a buffer day between work and the con, which meant I was mulling over work the whole con, which paradoxically
meant I felt more pressure to take the con to disconnect from work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sleeping in.</em> My overall stress level being high made it hard to sleep in, which just exacerbated the issues above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What should I start doing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Prioritizing the Artists Alley.</em> Every con, I wander through the Artists Alley looking for unique items to take home.
Any time something does, I remember how tightly my suitcase is packed and feel discouraged from purchasing it. I also
rationalize it away by saying that I could purchase it online, but I never end up doing so.</p>
<p>Artwork continues to spark my emotional connection to the fandom, and for future cons within driving distance, I want
to make space for items from the Artists Alley.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Spend more time with silent suiters.</em> This is carried over from FWA, but it's still something I'm interested in
exploring more of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
