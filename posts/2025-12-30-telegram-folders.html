<h2><em>Cutting through chaos:</em> how I organize Telegram</h2>
<p><em>Dec 30, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>While I'm <s>procrastinating</s> ruminating on my end-of-year review, I thought it'd be fun to show off how I organize
Telegram.</p>
<p><img src="../resources/2025-12-30-telegram.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Telegram" /></p>
<p>My chat organization scheme has developed naturally over time, but if I had to come up with principles that I use to
organize them:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Prioritization.</em> The bulk of my Telegram folders are manually curated, and the bulk of those have pinned chats.</li>
<li><em>Object permanence.</em> I make use of spatial memory where relevant.</li>
</ul>
