<h2>Babyfur Con 2025: Doubling Down on Padding Up</h2>
<p><em>Nov 25, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Babyfur Con has been a bucket-list convention for me. Its first year, I chickened out. Its second year, I was busy and
it fell off my radar. This year, I decided to go. I'd always heard fantastic things about the convention — everyone
who's gone has raved about it — but I still wasn't sure if I would enjoy it. Even though I've been into ABDL for as long
as I can remember, I've never quite felt comfortable in my own skin about it, especially around others.</p>
<p>On the first day, there's the &quot;pants drop ceremony&quot;, where, once the venue is fully locked down, the convention
officially starts. Like its name suggests, the pants drop ceremony is a gathering where folks celebrate by taking off
their pants to show off the kiddo clothing they have on underneath! And after a second of hesitation, I too was
unbuckling my belt. The pants drop ceremony was just one part among many at BFC that let me finally loosen my guard
around ABDL, and I had a joyful time at BFC.</p>
<p>Babyfur Con came at a time when I was looking to find myself and rekindle my interests. I had been living in New York in
a crappy, cramped apartment for a year, feeling isolated and moderately depressed. BFC gave me a vision that things
could be much better; I could be in a better place with people and things that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I'm reflecting in November, and BFC was in September. With two months of hindsight, I've realized the ways that
embracing bits of my babyfur side has improved my wellbeing: from the pep in my step when I walk around San Francisco
with my Lego backpack, or the warmth I feel when I open the door to my colorful room.</p>
<p>This isn't a review of the convention itself (I thought it was extremely well ran), nor is it my feelings attending the
con (I absolutely loved it). Instead, it's my thoughts on how effectively I was able to enjoy the convention.</p>
<h3>What went well?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Staying in the convention headspace.</em> I was padded the whole convention, and wore as much (or as little) as I felt
like. It felt so freeing to wear diapers, pajamas, and little-core attire, knowing that it was accepted and
encouraged.</p>
<p>All credit to BFC though: the convention made staying in headspace a breeze. As one example of many, the in-hotel
restaurant was touched up to match the con, with coloring page menus and themed food items. Being able to stay in the
environment the whole time, even for food, amplified the whole experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Rooming with two close friends.</em> I spent most of my time with my roommates, and it was great spending each day
together to return back to the room to relax or change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Embracing my DL side.</em> Thanks for all the huffy memories! <code>;)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What could have gone better?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Exploring my AB side.</em> I've been a DL for as long as I can remember, but I haven't had as much exposure to AB stuff.
Was I truly not into it, or had I not explored enough to spark my own interest?</p>
<p>I got to try a handful of AB activities for the first time at BFC, including getting in a bouncer, eating food in a
highchair, and sleeping in a crib. None of those activities did much for me. I barely went into the playroom or kidfur
spaces either, despite them being open and available.</p>
<p>I'm still open to exploring more of the adult baby space, but I think the bulk of my enjoyment is on the diaper lover
side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What should I start doing?</h3>
<p>Babyfur Con stands on its own, so I'm hoping to apply these at the next BFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Spend more downtime in the nursery, kidfur (?), and playroom spaces.</em> This being my first BFC, I felt the constant
pressure to <em>go go go!</em>, but I felt I missed out on experiencing these more relaxed spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Get into the schoolroom.</em> (I wished the line wasn't always so long!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
