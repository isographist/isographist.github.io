<h2>Hello, world</h2>
<p><em>March 1, 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Heya. My name's Lea. I live in the New York metro area, where I work as a software engineer. In my spare time, I enjoy
going to conventions, listening to music, and messing around with computers.</p>
<h3>Why start a blog?</h3>
<p>There are three main reasons.</p>
<p>First, I want to clarify my own thoughts. Writing has always been a forcing function for me to refine my ideas. It lets
me take the swirl of thoughts and feelings I have on a day-to-day basis, and distill them into something I can take with
me. By offloading them onto a page, I get some sense of finality, and so can move on.</p>
<p>Second, I want a way to remember. Even periods of great happiness, like traveling to my first furry convention, or
wearing a fursuit for the first time, I find I don't have any solid recollection. It's painful for me knowing these
events genuinelly happened, but not being able to recall any of the specifics. I'd love to be able to revisit those
memories, but since the past is gone, the best I can do is record my present experiences for the future.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to share my thoughts. Short-form social media, which I view as the only other alternative, is not for me.
I exist on Bluesky and Twitter, but I find it hard to justify posting anything. I often think to myself: <em>why is
<strong>this</strong> particular thought more worthy than any other?</em> So in the end, I just bottle up.</p>
<p>Bluesky and Twitter also feel too engagement focused to me. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy getting likes and
follows, but I also find they're counterproductive—the topics that garner engagement just aren't the ones that I want to
write about.</p>
<h3>Why should you care?</h3>
<p>You probably shouldn't. I'm doing this for myself. Rather than putting this in a diary, I'm blogging because the mere
thought that someone <em>might</em> stumble upon this, read it, judge me for it gives me the motivation to refine my writing.</p>
<h3>What can you come to expect?</h3>
<p>Sitting here at my desk, on a lazy Saturday afternoon, here are some topics I could see myself posting about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furry conventions. The things I did, what I enjoyed, and the lessons I learned.</li>
<li>Computers. I find computability theory, computer graphics, and formal verification fascinating.</li>
<li>Life philosophy? Like most people not in a committed relationship, I'm slightly terrified of dying alone.</li>
<li>Nothing at all. I think it's a real possibility this is the first and last post I make, though for the reasons I
outlined above, I hope I reflect positively on the time spent writing and continue to do so.</li>
</ul>
